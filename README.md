# Few-Shot Ball Bearing Anomaly Detection using Prototypical Networks

This repository presents a lightweight few-shot learning approach for detecting anomalies in ball bearing images.  Prototypical Networks with a ResNet18 backbone, this project demonstrates high classification accuracy even with limited data â€” making it ideal for industrial inspection tasks with scarce labeled examples.
